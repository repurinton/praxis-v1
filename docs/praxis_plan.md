# Praxis Plan — Verification-Aware Autonomous CFO

## Thesis
A verification-aware, agentic architecture can produce standards-conforming financial reports
with improved factual accuracy, numeric integrity, and auditability by binding generation to
explicit evidence and governed verification gates.

## Objectives
- Enforce evidence attribution for all claims
- Guarantee numeric agreement with source records
- Reduce hallucinations through deterministic verification
- Support human-in-the-loop governance

## Architecture Principles
- Claims are first-class objects
- Evidence is explicit and auditable
- Verification gates precede release
- Evaluation is mandatory and measurable

## Non-Negotiables
- No claim without evidence
- Verification failures block release
- Metrics drive iteration
