# Praxis Project

This is the initial scaffold for a new project following the Praxis baseline roadmap.

## Purpose

This repository implements the Praxis research project: a verification-aware, agentic architecture for producing standards-conforming financial reports (an “autonomous CFO” system).

The system is designed to:
- Bind generation to explicit evidence and verification
- Enforce numeric and factual correctness thresholds
- Support governed human oversight and release gates
- Enable reproducible evaluation of factuality, attribution coverage, and reporting cycle time

## Structure

- `src/` – source code will go here
- `tests/` – tests will go here

## Setup

Clone the repository. Project requirements and setup will be specified in future milestones.

## Running Tests

Instructions for running tests will be added once the test harness is set up.
